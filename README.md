        ABSTRACT

Airline reservation System is a computerized system used to store and retrieve information and conduct transactions related to air travel. The project is aimed at exposing the relevance and importance of Airline Reservation Systems. It is projected towards enhancing the relationship between customers and airline agencies through the use of ARSs, and thereby making it convenient for the customers to book the flights as when they require such that they can utilize this software to make reservations.





INTRODUCTION :

An airline reservation system (ARS) is part of the so-called passenger service systems (PSS), which are applications supporting the direct contact with the passenger.
ARS eventually evolved into the computer reservations system (CRS). A computer reservation system is used for the reservations of a particular airline and interfaces with a global distribution system (GDS) which supports travel agencies and other distribution channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a single system.Today all persons are busy with their schedule and no one have time to make a trip for holidays with their family. And this Airline Reservation Process is very difficult to understand in General meaning. But we are providing a Solution for that Problem. We are giving a all this facility in one project “Airline Reservation System”.

 

PURPOSE AND ITS DESCRIPTION :

This software has two parts. First is user part and the administrator part. User part is used as a front end and administrator is the back end. Administrator is used by airline authority. It will allow the customers to access database and allow new customers to sign up for online access.
The system allows the airline passenger to search for flights that are available between the two travel cities, namely the “Departure city” and “Arrival city” for a particular departure and arrival dates. The system displays all the flight’s details   such   as   flight   no,   name,   price   and   duration   of   journey   etc.

After search the system display list of available flights and allows customer to choose a particular flight. Then the system checks for the availability of seats on the flight. If the seats are available then the system allows the passenger to book a     seat.     Otherwise     it     asks     the     user     to     choose     another flight.

To book a flight the system asks the customer to enter his details such as name, address, city, state, and credit card number and contact number. Then it checks the validity of card and book the flight and update the airline database and user database. The system also allows the customer to cancel his/her reservation, if any problem occurs.
The main purpose of this software is to reduce the manual errors involved in the airline reservation process and make it convenient for the customers to book the flights as when they require such that they can utilize this software to make reservations, modify reservations or cancel a particular reservation.
